  <h2>Welcome to my puzzles page</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! My name is Justin, and this is my puzzle collection (and a few non-puzzles).
    I gravitate more towards vintage puzzles, and enjoy discovering the history behind the puzzles. You can tell a lot of my tastes by what puzzles
    I have the most.
    This is my attempt to catalog all my puzzles, in hopes that others might find it useful as well. I've learned a lot from others' puzzle websites
    and enjoy talking with other puzzle enthusiasts. Hope you enjoy!
