  <h3>Justin's Blog</h3>
  <p>I would like this site to be more than just a place to showcase my puzzles,
    although that is certainly a big part of it. I would also like to go more
    in depth on some of the puzzles, either the history, or the analysis, or whatever
    meets my fancy. So whenever I have something on my mind, I'll add it here.
    Not much yet, but check back for updates!

      <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a> {{ post.date | date_to_long_string: "ordinal", "US" }}
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
