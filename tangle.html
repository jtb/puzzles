title: Puzzling Pastimes Tanglements
---

<div class="w3-container">
  <h3>Tanglements</h3>
  <p>
    The goal is to take the puzzle apart and put it back together. Typically putting it
    back together is at least as hard as taking it apart. While many would call these Disentanglement puzzles,
    I like Rob's term "Tanglement" because it is a reminder that to truly solve the puzzle you need to put it
    back to it's original unsolved state, so Disen-tanglement and Reen-tanglemnt are both needed.
    These puzzles usually don't have any hidden parts. Everything is laid bare for you to see, yet it is still
    very challenging to take them apart. I like that aspect of these puzzles, because it allows you to reason
    about the puzzle (as opposed to fumbling around to try to find some hidden mechanism).
