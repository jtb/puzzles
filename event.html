title: Puzzling Pastimes Commemorating Events

<div class="w3-container">
  <h3>Events</h3>
  <p>
    Puzzles have been used to commemorate events, such as World Fairs and Expositions.
    The objects here can also be found in their respective categories, but I thought it
    would be fun to list together all the ones that mark some event.
