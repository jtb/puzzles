title: Puzzling Pastimes Permutations

<div class="w3-container">
  <h3>Permutations</h3>
  <p>
    These puzzles consist of pieces that can be moved around in different arragments. There is
    usually constraints on their movements, such as only being able to slide or rotate certain pieces, such as Rubik's cubes.
    I've collected a lot of 2d sliding puzzles, so have put those into their own section.
