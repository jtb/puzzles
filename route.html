title: Puzzling Pastimes Route Finding

<div class="w3-container">
  <h3>Route Finding</h3>
  <p>
    These are your maze puzzles, where you try to get a traveler from a starting point
    to an ending point. Many puzzles can be abstracted into a route finding puzzle, but the ones
    listed here are those where the physical embodiment of the puzzle maps directly to a maze.
