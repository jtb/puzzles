# The Arabi Gun Puzzle Video!

<p>
I was very excited to receive this puzzle so I thought I'd share my unboxing. This puzzle is called 'The Arabi Gun puzzle' and can be found in Professor Hoffmann's 1893 book 'Puzzles Old and New'. It is made by turning wood on a lathe. A few of the puzzles mentioned in the book are
produced by woodturning. I'm not aware of any other place these wood turned puzzles were sold besides in Victorian London. You could find them in the high end toy stores like Hamley's, where Charles Dickens was known to visit. He would take his children there on Christmas to pick out gifts, while he perused the magic section, since he was an amateur magician.

I believe the puzzle is in reference to the Urabi revolt, led by Ahmed Urabi (there seems to be various English spellings for this Arabic name - both Arabi and Urabi). The British forces intervened in the revolt and defeated Urabi's army. In one of the battles, the British fleet bombarded the Egyptian guns in Alexandria. A picture of one of the canons looks strikingly similar to the puzzle canon.

Here is my video. I attempt to go through the solution at the end but made it clear when that section starts. Hope you enjoy!
