# My First 3D Print Model
I attempted my first 3d print modeling! Recently I purchased an intricate cube dissection puzzle from the '60s made in Japan. It is known as "Think", and there's a nice write up of it on the [PuzzleMad site](https://www.puzzlemad.co.uk/2021/01/happy-new-year-my-top-tenish-of-2020.html). I knew it was a fragile puzzle so wasn't surprised that one of the pieces was broken. So I thought it would be a good opportunity to try to 3d print it!

I fortunately have a friend with a 3d printer who doesn't mind entertaining my puzzle enthusiasm. I didn't think it would be too hard since all the pieces are rectilinear. Indeed, modeling wasn't too bad. The toughest part was leaving some gap between pieces so they would slide together without force. The real challenge came with the actual printing since there are tons of overhangs in the pieces. I first tried to print each piece whole, but that needed a lot of supports. No matter how hard I tried to remove all the supports, they left barnacles that prevented the pieces from sliding together. Below is the results of my first attempt.

Undeterred, I decided to print some of the pieces in multiple parts and glue them together. It worked and I now have a functional puzzle!

It is an enjoyable puzzle and very satisfying when it all slides in place. I would probably make some refinements in the third iteration, but I'm pleased with how it turned out. Now I've entered dangerous new territory where I can start thinking about creating my own puzzle designs.
