# A Psychology Experiment using Mechanical Puzzles

In 1910, Henry Alford Ruger published a book entitled


>The Psychology of Efficiency:
>an experimental study of the processes involved
>in the solution of mechanical puzzles
>and in the acquisition of skill in their manipulation

Whew! Quite the mouthful. I can't say that I have actually read the book - but it involves
studying participants attempting to solve mechanical puzzles. The best part of the book - it has a
great picture of all the mechanical puzzles used in the study!

The book says this work was in partial fulfillment for a degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Columbia University.
Indeed, I confirmed that a Henry Alford Ruger received his phD in 1910, so these puzzles are from around that time.

Here is the best copy I could find of the picture
