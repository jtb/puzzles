# The Case of the Puzzling Star Puzzle

While browsing eBay a while ago, I came across a wire puzzle with a design
I hadn't seen before. The title said it was vintage, and that seemed plausible
judging from the patina. This is usually my type of puzzle - old and wirey.
But this couldn't possibly be a puzzle, could it?
It seemed pretty simply - move the triangle piece around the star until you get
to the end and take it off. I did what I always do when I don't recognize a
puzzle - search on [Rob's Puzzle Page](http://www.robspuzzlepage.com/mainmenu.htm),
[Jerry Slocum's collection](https://libraries.indiana.edu/databases/slocum),
and [The Puzzle Museum](https://www.puzzlemuseum.com/), but I couldn't find any
additional information about it. The asking price seemed reasonable but the
shipping was on the high side, so decided to pass it up.

I didn't think much about it until I came across it again while I was back on eBay.
What if the gap was too small simply to slide the triangle off the end of the
spiral star? Then, this would be an interesting puzzle. So I tried searching
again. This time I went to the Patents. Google provides a nice
[search for patents](https://patents.google.com/), although I find it a little harder
to use than typical Google search. It really helps to know some of the tags.
Patents are grouped by category, and I knew that if this was in the patent database,
it would most likely be under **A63F9/0876 Bent wire or cord puzzles**.
So I searched
```
  star (A63F9/0876) before:1920  
```

And sure enough, one of the results returned was that star puzzle!

Ok, now I'm sold. Yes this is a puzzle, and it has a backstory. I now know the
designer and date of the patent. I decided to make an offer with a few dollars off
to compensate for the high shipping price, and the seller accepted.

That would have been a good end to the story, but there's more! Even though the patent was from 1907,
that doesn't mean this instance of the puzzle is that old. Maybe someone found the patent
and made one last week. But I don't think this ever became a very popular puzzle,
so there was a good chance this was made around the time of the patent. Plus, like I
mentioned earlier, it seemed like it had a chance to be old based on how it looked in the
photos. The puzzle arrived today, and I looked to see if there were any marks on it
that would indicate the maker or any other information. I was very excited when I found in very small but very clear
letters: **PAT PEND.**, which of course stands for Patent Pending. So there is a very
high probability that this indeed was made in 1907 when the patent was being processed!

This ticks off a lot of boxes for me - Tanglement puzzle. Check. Old. Check. Patented. Check.
And oh yeah, how is it as a puzzle? Well it did stump me for a while but I managed to solve it.
I wonder how long that puzzle has been waiting to be solved. I think it's actually a pretty good puzzle
and will fit nicely in my vintage metal tanglement collection.

**Update:** I did find on Rob's Puzzle Page the 'Star Maze' by Fiddl'Widdit which looks very much like this puzzle, so seems like
there actually are some modern examples of this puzzle.
