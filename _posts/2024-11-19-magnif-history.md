# The Story of Mag-Nif
William W. Knox founded the Mag-Nif company in 1963 in Ohio. He was president/CEO from 1963 to 1997. It seems that the first product was the Pixie Bow Making kit, but they expanded to puzzles, games, and coin banks. In 1976, they were listed as manufacturer of Adult Games, Puzzles, Plastic Flowers, and Bow maker & Ribbon Items for Gift Wrapping. They seem to still be in existence but concentrating more on animated coin sorting banks. Their hay day for puzzles was between 1969 and 1990. They operated in Painsville, Ohio for a short time before moving operation to Mentor, Ohio around 1966.

## Logos and Taglines
The original logo was a pixie with a bow, a tie to their bow making products. Later they used the Mag-Nif name.
Around 1989, they started displaying the name as Magnif, as opposed to Mag-Nif.
They often used the tagline "Mag-Nif makes it!"

## Puzzles and Games
In the 1960s, they made two games: Numble (1965) and Tumble Numble (1966). Numble appears to be a Scrabble-like game except with numbers rather than letters. The first puzzle I was able to find from them was Magic Box, from 1969. The 70s seems to be a time of greatest expansion into puzzles. Many of the puzzles they produced throughout the 80s were first produced in the 70s, including their most well known and loved puzzle - The Brain, first produced in 1973. Mag-Nif would periodically update the packaging of their puzzles. The Brain, for example, has 7 different packages, spanning over 30 years, pictured below.

### List of Puzzles and Games
Here is a list of Mag-Nif puzzles and games, at least all the ones I could find. I'm only listing games and puzzles,
even though they made other products like banks and coin sorters. I also included
the copyright on the packaging, since many puzzles were in production throughout several years.
If the puzzle was part of a series, I included that as well.
