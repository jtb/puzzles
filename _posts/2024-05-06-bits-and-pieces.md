# Bits & Pieces Catalog

A while back, I asked the Mechanical Puzzle Community on Facebook if there were any lists
out there of Bits & Pieces puzzles. The answer seemed to be No, so I decided to create one
that others could contribute to. Bits & Pieces is a company that has created many
mechanical puzzles over the years. They are still in existence but seem to be concentrating
more on jigsaw puzzles. The quality of the puzzles seem to be hit or miss. Some seem to be
really nice and highly sought after. Others, not so much. Most of them are given ids that typically
start with 07-... So seemed like a great thing to try to catalog.

The little experiment has been successful. The list is still growing. Special thanks to Thomas Jolly
who contributed a lot of the data. It would be nice if there were pictures attached to each, but I've
mostly added to the list by scouring the web and so don't own any of the pictures. However, I tried to add
links that contain pictures, although there is no guarantee that those links will always work. Hope you find this useful!
