title: Puzzling Pastimes Calendars

<div class="w3-container">
  <h3>Calendar</h3>
  <p>
    Before we could look up the date on our phone, people needed other ways to
    find the date. Of course, wall calendars worked fine, but are too big to carry
    around. People invented clever ways to condense the information to the size of a
    coin that you could carry around in your pocket. I like collecting these too,
    as a reminder of a bygone era before electronic computers.
