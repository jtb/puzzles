title: Puzzling Pastimes Sequential Movement
---

<div class="w3-container">
  <h3>Sequential Movement</h3>
  <p>
    In these puzzles, the moves are typically apparent and finite but typically require many
    moves to get to the end state. I especially enjoy N-ary puzzles, which are puzzles that
    can easily be extended to create puzzles with more and more steps, typically with exponential growth.
